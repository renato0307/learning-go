# GitHub actions running locally

We are going to use [github.com/nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to
run GitHub actions locally.

My main reason is (described in the `act` README file):

> __Fast Feedback__ - Rather than having to commit/push every time you want to 
test out the changes you are making to your `.github/workflows/` files you can
use `act` to run the actions locally.

So, follow up the installations instructions.

Run `act -h` to ensure the installation is working.
