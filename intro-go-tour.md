# The Go Tour

The Go Tour covers the most important features of the language.

Please take 30 to 60 minutes to go over it to facilitate the rest of the
learning.

The tour is available at [https://go.dev/tour](https://go.dev/tour).

If you can't do it I'll explain the less obvious parts of the code and also
provide the "GO-EXTRA" blocks with more information about certain topics. 

Whenever you see "🕵️‍♀️ __GO-EXTRA__", it is a block with additional contents, not
critical for the current context, that you can skip to read later.
