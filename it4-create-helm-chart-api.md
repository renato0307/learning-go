# Create a Helm chart for the API

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is a package manager for Kubernetes. It helps you
define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

From the [Helm introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zzwq9FmZdsU):

> __Package Management:__ Tooling that enables someone who has knowledge of an
> application and a platform to package up an application so that someone else
> with who has neither extensive knowledge of the application or the way it
> needs to be run on the platform can use it.

Watch the video linked above before proceeding.

One of the most important concepts in Helm are
[charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts):

> Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A chart is a collection of files
> that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be
> used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex,
> like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on.

To install Helm you can follow the instructions at
[https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install).

To store the infrastructure related configurations we are going to create a new
repository named `learning-go-api-iac`. Head to GitHub and create one for you.
After, clone it to your machine so we can start building a chart for the API.

To create a chart execute the following command:

```sh
mkdir charts && cd charts
helm create learning-go-api
```

After running the following files and directories will be created:

```
learning-go-api
├── charts                  # A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends
├── Chart.yaml              # A YAML file containing information about the chart
├── templates               # A directory of templates that, when combined with values,
                            # will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files
│   ├── deployment.yaml     # Template for a deployment (DELETE IF NOT NEEDED)
│   ├── _helpers.tpl        # Helper templates to be used in other templates
│   ├── hpa.yaml            # Template for auto scaling (DELETE IF NOT NEEDED)
│   ├── ingress.yaml        # Template for an ingress (DELETE IF NOT NEEDED)
│   ├── NOTES.txt           # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing short usage notes
│   ├── serviceaccount.yaml # Template for a service account (DELETE IF NOT NEEDED)
│   ├── service.yaml        # Template for a service (DELETE IF NOT NEEDED)
│   └── tests               # Pod definitions to check the status of the application
└── values.yaml             # The default configuration values for this chart
```

For the current version of our API we will need to define the following k8s
resources:

1. A [Mamespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces)
dedicated to the learning-go-api
1. A [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service)
exposing the API and load balancing the traffic to pods
1. A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
to manage and scale pods
1. Several [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods) managed by 
the deployment to run the API containers
1. A [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret)
containing the API key to call the backend financial API

The following diagram illustrates all the resources:

![k8s](./assets/k8s.png)

The files generated by the `helm create` command build a skeleton for most of
the resources we need.

But we need to do some clean up and change the generated templates to build
this solution.

## Clean up

We are not going to use some of the files generated by the `helm create` 
command so we can delete them.

```sh
rm carts/learning-go-api/templates/ingress.yaml
rm carts/learning-go-api/templates/serviceaccount.yaml
rm carts/learning-go-api/templates/hpa.yaml
```
## Basic configurations

The `value.yaml` contains configuration values for this chart.

Let's open it and update a couple of things:

1. The `image.repository` should be `renato0307/learning-go-api`
1. The `serviceAccount.create` must be set to `false`
1. The `service.type` must be `LoadBalancer` and the `service.port` change to
`9000`
1. In the `resources` section uncomment the values

We also need to change the `Chart.yaml` file and update the following:

1. `appVersion` must match the GitHub tag for the `learning-go-api`, which
should be `0.0.3` at this moment.


## Create the namespace

All k8s resources will be created under a
[namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces),
to allow the isolation from other resources in the cluster.

The namespace will be  named `learning-go-api` and we can created it by
running the following command:

```sh
kubectl create ns learning-go-api
```

## Secrets

We are going to use secrets to store the API key for the currency conversion.

First create a file named `secrets.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: learning-go-api-secrets
type: Opaque
data:
  CURRCONV_API_KEY: <the value of the API key in base64>
```

Next, create the secret resource by running `kubectl apply`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f secrets.yaml -n learning-go-api
```

The result should be:

```
secret/learning-go-api-secrets created
```

As this contains sensitive information, delete the `secrets.yaml` file:

```sh
rm secrets.yaml
```

## Deployment changes

Open the `deployment.yaml` and in the `containers` list, add the
`CURRCONV_API_KEY` environment variable. Additionally also change the container
port to be `8080`, the default port exposed by Gin.

```yaml
# ...
containers:
    - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
        securityContext:
        {{- toYaml .Values.securityContext | nindent 12 }}
        image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag | default .Chart.AppVersion }}"
        imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
        env:                                    # new
        - name: CURRCONV_API_KEY                # new
          valueFrom:                            # new
            secretKeyRef:                       # new
                name: learning-go-api-secrets   # new
                key: CURRCONV_API_KEY           # new
        ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080               # change
# ...
```

## Install the chart

To install the chart in the cluster run the following command.

This will create a chart named `learning-go-api`, using the definitions found in
`carts/learning-go-api`, putting all resources in the `learning-go-api` namespace.

```sh
helm install learning-go-api carts/learning-go-api --namespace learning-go-api
```

To check if everything is OK, list the pods for the `learning-go-api` namespace:

```sh
kubectl -n learning-go-api get pods
```

You should see something simitar to (the pods must be ready and in the `Running`
status):

```sh
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
learning-go-api-6f7b4d9f79-64cpr   1/1     Running   0          84s
```

If we get the logs from the pod we should see the requests being made by the
liveness and readiness probes:

```sh
kubectl -n learning-go-api logs learning-go-api-6f7b4d9f79-64cpr 
```

The logs are:

```sh
...
[GIN] 2021/12/28 - 20:26:44 | 200 |       30.38µs |      10.244.0.1 | GET      "/"
[GIN] 2021/12/28 - 20:26:44 | 200 |       30.89µs |      10.244.0.1 | GET      "/"
[GIN] 2021/12/28 - 20:26:54 | 200 |       36.04µs |      10.244.0.1 | GET      "/"
[GIN] 2021/12/28 - 20:26:54 | 200 |       36.28µs |      10.244.0.1 | GET      "/"
[GIN] 2021/12/28 - 20:27:04 | 200 |      37.859µs |      10.244.0.1 | GET      "/"
[GIN] 2021/12/28 - 20:27:04 | 200 |       15.06µs |      10.244.0.1 | GET      "/"
[GIN] 2021/12/28 - 20:27:14 | 200 |       33.88µs |      10.244.0.1 | GET      "/"
[GIN] 2021/12/28 - 20:27:14 | 200 |        24.8µs |      10.244.0.1 | GET      "/"
```
## Testing the deployed API

The service should also be set up, allowing us to access the API.

 You can check it by running:

```sh
kubectl -n learning-go-api get svc
```

You'll be able to see something like:

```
NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE
learning-go-api   LoadBalancer   10.96.151.196   172.19.255.200   9000:31144/TCP   21m
```

Using the `EXTERNAL-IP`  and the `PORT` you would be able to call the API
using `httpie`:

```sh
http 172.19.255.200:9000
```

The result should be:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 51
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 28 Dec 2021 20:45:52 GMT

{
    "message": "Hello, welcome to the learning-go-api"
}
```
