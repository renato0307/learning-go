# Start the CLI project

The CLI will allows us to run the learning-go-api utility functions from the
command line.

So, in this section we will:

1. Create the CLI folder
1. Init the git repository
1. Enable dependency tracking for the Go code
1. Create the first Go file
1. Create a repository in github.com
1. Commit and push the initial version

The following commands are needed for steps 1, 2, and 3:

```sh
mkdir learning-go-cli && cd learning-go-cli
git init .
go mod init github.com/renato0307/learning-go-cli
```

Replace the `renato0307` part by the correct value for you. This should be the
value of a GitHub repository where you will store the project.

The `go mod init` command initializes and writes a new `go.mod` file in the
current directory, in effect creating a new module rooted at the current
directory.

The `go.mod` file describes the moduleâ€™s properties, including its dependencies
on other modules and on versions of Go.

Each time a new dependency is added running the `go mod tidy` command will
update the `go.mod` file.

The `go` command maintains a file named `go.sum` containing the expected 
cryptographic hashes of the content of specific module versions.

Next, open vscode by typing:

```sh
code .
```

Create a file named `main.go` with the following contents:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

To run this code, go back to the command line and enter:

```sh
go run main.go
```

You should see in the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Next, go to [https://github.com]() and create a repository.

In my case I named it `learning-go-cli`.

After the repository is created, add it as remote origin and do the initial commit and push:

```sh
echo "# learning-go-cli" >> README.md
git add .
git remote add origin git@github.com:renato0307/learning-go-cli.git
git commit -m "initial version"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
````

With this all set, we are ready to start doing some real code.
