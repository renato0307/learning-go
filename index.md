# Welcome to Learning Go

Learn Go by building a REST API and a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Both will have production quality so we additionally need to cover:
* Security
* Testing
* CI/CD & Deployment (in a Kubernetes cluster)
* Monitoring & Observability

__Are you ready?__

## Introduction

1. [What are we going to build?](intro-what-are-we-going-to-build.md)
1. [Prepare the development environment](intro-prepare-dev-env.md)
1. [Please do a Go tour](intro-go-tour.md)

## Iteration 1 - library and API skeleton

1. [Start the project for the Library](it1-lib-start-the-project.md)
1. [Add the first utility function to the Library](it1-lib-add-first-utility-function.md)
1. [Start the project for the API](it1-api-start-the-project.md)
1. [Add the first utility function to the API](it1-api-add-first-utility-function.md)
1. [Unit tests in the API using mocks](it1-api-unit-tests-with-mocks.md)

## Iteration 2 - basic CI/CD
1. [GitHub actions for the Library](it2-github-actions-for-the-library.md)
1. Create the Dockerfile for the API
1. GitHub actions for the API
1. Running GitHub actions locally

## Iteration 3 - consolidate concepts by adding more features
1. Add programming/jwt-debugger
3. Add finance/currency-converter

## Iteration 4 - deploying to kubernetes
1. Create a local kubernetes cluster
1. Create a Helm chart
1. Use [fluxcd](https://fluxcd.io) to deploy

## Next Iterations - WIP
