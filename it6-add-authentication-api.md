# Add authentication to the API

The goal of this section is to change the API to have an authentication based on
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) generated by our OAuth2 server (Amazon Cognito).

To achieve that we need:

1. Create a Gin middleware to intercept all requests and check the JWT
1. Verify the JWT [as described in the AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-verifying-a-jwt.html)

## Create the middleware

## Verify the JWT
